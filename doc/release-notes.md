# Upgrading and downgrading

## How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Sparks-Qt (on Mac) or
sparksd/sparks-qt (on Linux).

## Downgrade warning

### Downgrade to a version < v21.0.0

Downgrading to a version older than v21.0.0 may not be supported due to changes
if you are using descriptor wallets.

### Downgrade to a version < v19.2.0

Downgrading to a version older than v19.2.0 is not supported due to changes
in the evodb database. If you need to use an older version, you must either
reindex or re-sync the whole chain.
